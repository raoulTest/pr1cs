### Technical Implementation

#### State Management
- Use Convex `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks for each feature
- Form state with React `useState`
- Real-time updates via Convex subscriptions

#### UI Components
- Card-based layout for each feature section
- Forms with validation for create/update operations
- Buttons to trigger mutations
- Tables to display query results
- Real-time counters showing live data

#### Styling
- Use existing shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Input, Select, Table, Tabs)
- Tailwind CSS v4 with current theme
- Responsive grid layout

### Files to Create/Modify

1. **New Route**: `apps/web/src/routes/convex-showcase.tsx`
   - Main showcase page component
   - Tabbed interface
   - Feature testing panels

2. **Update Navigation**: `apps/web/src/components/header.tsx`
   - Add link to new showcase page

### Verification
After implementation, verify by:
1. Navigate to `/convex-showcase`
2. Test each tab's functionality
3. Create a booking and see it appear in real-time
4. Test AI chat functionality
5. Verify all mutations work correctly

### Implementation Notes
- Use existing Convex hooks and types
- Follow existing code patterns in dashboard.tsx and ai-booking.tsx
- Ensure proper error handling with toast notifications
- Use loading states for async operations
